<h2>15 Minute Banana & Egg Pancakes</h2>
<p>
    These traditional banana egg pancakes are fluffy and a bit more chewy.
    Small amount of baking powder and coconut flour keeps these pancakes grain-free and gives
    a cake-like texture.

<h4>Ingredients for Roasted Salmon</h4>
<h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>non-stick cooking spray</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter (softened or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp molasses</li>
    <li>1 (2.5 pound) salmon fillet</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Greek seasoning</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon (juiced, divided)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet
        with foil and spray with nonstick spray.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir butter and molasses together in a small bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
        Next add eggs, break yolks with a fork or whisk, and whisk thoroughly until well combined.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lay salmon, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread butter mixture evenly over
        the salmon. Sprinkle with Greek seasoning and drizzle with Â½ of the lemon juice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 17 to 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sprinkle with remaining lemon juice and serve.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>Cook's Notes</h4>
<p>
    You can use honey, maple syrup, or brown sugar in place of molasses. And instead of Greek seasoning,
    you can use salt and pepper, jerk seasoning, or Cajun seasoning... whatever you like!
